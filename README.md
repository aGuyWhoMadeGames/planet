# Planet
This is a project where I mostly just experiment and mess arround with a pure Gdscript LOD planetary terrain system I wrote.
In addition, this project also has a web-rtc based multiplayer system, multithreading, a gravity-changing player controller,
support for multiple planets, and a stylized atmoshere shader.
